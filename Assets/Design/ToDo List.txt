Importent/Must have:

- AI Programming (for solo matches)
- Search cards by name instead of serial number
- Networking Lobby (Fully functional and can hold enough players for all game modes (1v2, 2v2, 1v1, etc...))
- Fully Functioning Replay System:
	- Replays are saved as text files (for now)
	- Have a control to turn the replay recoring on or off (off to save space, on to save memories)
	- Start recording when match starts
	- Have it recording mid match (match is already started, start recording)
	- Have a thing where joining mid match, using the host's/server's current replay file to catch you up. All the while recording the mid match while catching up (always following the host's/server's ever chaning and updating replay file)
	- Have a system that creates a replay as the game goes on, writing a file in coded symbols or text commands (such as NSum = Normal Summon, [P2 M: 55]A[P1 M: 45] = Player2's monster attacks Player1's monster).
	- Have a button to re-watch old replays. (reading all the coded things in the file)
