Game-Breaking (A-Bugs):
- Server side cannot control it's own player
- Host is having problems getting client's deck. (Multiplayer)
- Client is having problems getting both decks. (Multiplayer)

Major (B-Bugs):
- Option menu features are not implemented (Dummy Buttons)

Minor (C-Bugs):
- Makes an error when Options is exited. (something to do with the back button being NULL (start of the second page))

Would be nice to add (D-Bugs):
- Would be nice to have a searching function to search cards by name instead by serial number.
- Would be nice to let the players know that both player's picked the same hand in (Rock-Paper-Scissors).
