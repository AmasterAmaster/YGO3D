Game-Breaking (A-Bugs):
- Player2(Clone) does not spawn
- Server side cannot control it's own player

Major (B-Bugs):
- Option menu features are not implemented (Dummy Buttons)

Minor (C-Bugs):
- Makes an error when Options is exited. (something to do with the back button being NULL (start of the second page))
- Makes an error when starting Multiplayer match, complaining about a textmesh being NULL.

Would be nice to add (D-Bugs):
- Would be nice to have a searching function to search cards by name instead by serial number.
